# Power Logger

This software connects to the API of a local or remote Shelly Plus Plug S and reads the power consumption data. It logs
the data to a file and optionally displays it in a plot.

## Usage

Enter your Shelly Plus Plug S credentials in `statc.py`.  
Run `main.py` to start logging. Set the flags to change between local and remote logging, and to enable/disable the
display.
